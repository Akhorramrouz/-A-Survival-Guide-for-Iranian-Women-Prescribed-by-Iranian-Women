# A Survival Guide for Iranian Women Prescribed by Iranian Women

Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a global issue affecting over 2 billion women worldwide. Our paper makes two key contributions:

1. We present the first-ever computational analysis of user comments on accounts of Intimate Partner Physical Violence (IPPV) in Iran. By analyzing a substantial corpus of 53,220 comments on 1,563 IPPV posts, gleaned from over 10 million comments posted on 523,232 posts on a popular parental health website in Iran, we shed light on the gender struggles in a country with documented stark gender inequality. We utilize large language models and participatory AI to tackle extreme class imbalance and linguistic challenges associated with low-resource languages. With active input from a woman with a history of advocacy for social rights and grounding in Iranian culture, we categorize comments on IPPV into three broad categories: empathy, confront, and conform. Our analyses reveal that the majority of IPPV comments express confront.

2. We release a dataset of 3,400 annotated comments on IPPV posts

_Last night, my husband beat me so much. He kicked me in the back and stomach so hard that I cannot get up. He told me to pack up and go to my father's place without causing further trouble._

**Comment:**
ببین به خاطر بچت سعی کن جنگ اعصابو کناربزاری اگه آدمه بدیه براخودش بده... باهاش دعوا نکن هروقت اومد تو خونه فکرکن اون بهترین مرد دنیاست...
*Translation:*  
_Look, for the sake of your child, try to put this mental war aside. If he is a bad person, he is bad for himself. Do not fight with him. Whenever he comes home, imagine he is the **best man in the world**._
