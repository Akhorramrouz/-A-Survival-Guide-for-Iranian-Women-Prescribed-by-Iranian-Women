Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a global problem affecting more than 2 billion women worldwide. Our paper makes two key contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of 53,220 comments to 1,563 Intimate Partner Physical Violence (IPPV) posts gleaned from more than 10 million comments posted on 523,232 posts on a popular parental health website in Iran, we present the first-ever computational analysis of user comments on accounts of IPPV in Iran. We harness large language models and participatory AI and tackle extreme class imbalance and other linguistic challenges that arise from tackling low-resource languages to shed light on the gender struggles of a country with documented stark gender inequality. With active input from a woman with a history of advocacy for social rights and grounded in Iranian culture, we characterize comments on IPPV into three broad categories: \textit{empathy}, \textit{confront}, and \textit{conform.}  Our analyses reveal that the majority of IPPV comments express \textit{confront}. Second, we release two datasets: (1) a dataset of 2,137 instances of IPPV posts (1,563 positives and 574 negatives); and (2) a dataset of 3,400 comments on IPPV posts.
